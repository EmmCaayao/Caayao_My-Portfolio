Welcome to my portfolio! It contains essential information about me, including my skills, projects, and contact details. 

This portfolio highlights both my computer and general skills. The projects showcased are from my programming studies, with two projects selected from each subject: two from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) during my first semester last year, and two from my first year as a BSIS student in Computer Programming. 

I added some basic CSS styling along with some simpple javascripts to make it more pretty. Despite the struggle, I really enjoyed making this! Watching tutorials online and learning from both online and my professor has been a delight, I hope to learn more in the future.

Lastly, it contains my contact info in order for people to reach out to me for questions, along with my github account.
